            <p class="lead">What in the world are smart glasses? Simply put, they are an attempt to bring the wireless connectivity and imaging we enjoy 
                on our home computers and cellphones into the frames and lenses of our eyewear.
                Just as we can no longer imagine living without a laptop or mobile phone, soon we may enjoy the same versatility and connectivity from our eyeglasses, and even our contact lenses. 
                Quite an eye-opener, wouldn’t you say? </p>

            <ul>
                <li class="lead">Google’s Android operating system,Android Studio is the
                    main and official integrated development environment
                    (IDE) , built on JetBrains’ IntelliJ IDEA software which
                    is designed only for Android development.
                    It is available for download on Windows, macOS and
                    Linux based operating systems.It has replaced the Eclipse
                    Android Development Tools (ADT) which was a primary
                    IDE for native Android application development.
                    Kotlin is also a language used for app development
                    which is a replacement of Java as Google’s preferred
                    language for Android app development.</li>
                <li class="lead">When we connect the android app with the HC-05
                    bluetooth of Smart Glass, the device will send the data
                    which is in the form of strings to the Arduino through
                    Bluetooth.The data in the form of Strings includes current
                    Date and Time and also incoming call or text is transmitted.The transmitted data is received by
                    Arduino which is
                    then displayed on OLED screen.

                <p class="lead">• Now we move on to the Android Application Part.
                    Establishing a connection is based on the client-server
                    model. The server socket is created by server which waits
                    for incoming connection requests, then the client socket
                    is created by client which sends a connection request to
                    the server.</p>
                <p class="lead">• The second socket is generated when server accepts this
                    request which is used to communicate with this client
                    which makes it possible to send and receive data both
                    ways.</p>
                <p class="lead"> • Set permissions : First, we set the permissions in the
                    Android Manifest file.Bluetooth and Bluetooth Admin are
                    needed.</p>
                <p class="lead">• Check Availability of Bluetooth : We use the Bluetooth
                    Adapter class to check Bluetooth’s availability. Phone’s
                    built-in Bluetooth module is represented here. To check
                    if our device has Bluetooth to start with we will use this
                    class. To check if Bluetooth is enabled or not, we can
                    call up the system’s dialog window asking the user if to
                    turn Bluetooth on.</p>

                    <p class="lead">After app is created we transmit the data from phone
                        to Arduino once it is connected to HC-05 Bluetooth
                        Module.After data is received by Arduino a code is
                        written to print the data received from phone to the OLED
                        screen.We use the AltSoftSerial and Adafruit Libraries to
                        run the code. </p>
                    <p class="lead">Receiving data:The Reception of Data is not complicated.Beacuse in
                        microcontroller Hello world is just LED
                        blinking but here, Hello World is little bit advanced.It is
                        Achieved by changing the state of LED as and when Data
                        is received through Bluetooth.</p>
                    <p class="lead">Pairing devices:The establishment of Bluetooth connection is done
                        by pairing them.Device paring takes place
                        only once.The process looks like this:
                        Enable the Bluetooth HC-05 of device then it will be
                        visible to the surrounding.
                        Then we choose other device when we scan for other device.When Bluetooth Module is detected
                        Pairing request
                        is send to other device.A pop-up message is shown up
                        in our Android Device naturally the password is 1234 or
                        0000,When the password is right we will see that our
                        Bluetooth device is in the paired devices section.</p>

                  </strong></p><p class="lead">Google Glasses will, of course, have a smaller screen than a PC. But the
                    glasses will also have a smaller screen than any smart phone on the market. The
                    viewing area is minimal, and it only resides on the right hand side. Because of this,
                    everything that is rendered for Google Glass will be incredibly small. This will
                    create a whole new medium for Web viewing and usability. Google and third-party
                    interests will need to explore different ways to perform actions and render data.</p>

                    2.Less Browser Changing</strong> </p>

                <p class="lead">
                Google will, of course, make their browser available first for use through Google
                    Glass, and this will result in most users sticking with that browser. However, it
                    is safe to say that new browsers will most likely be introduced later. Regardless,
                    this will mean more market share for Google-owned browsers.</p>

                <p class="lead"><strong> 
                3. Less Switching Of Applications</strong> </p>

            <p class="lead">
            When we are on smart phones, we often switch from app to app to accomplish an
                    objective. With Google Glass, we can expect to start with a core set of abilities
                    that are inherent to the operating system. Following this, applications will be
                    introduced and their use will grow. While this is true, Google will get the first crack
                    at developing all the functionality needed for the device, much like the advantage
                    Apple had with the iPhone. If Google can do this well, they will limit the need
                    for new apps and gain more control of this new market.</p>

                <p class="lead"><strong> 
                4. A Greater Need For Voice Recognition Technology</strong> </p>

            <p class="lead">
            Most of the usability in this device is activated based on voice recognition. Google
                    has improved their abilities here, but voice recognition and activation technology
                    is still very new and buggy. Google will need to continue to improve and expand
                    the capabilities of this technology to make the product successful long-term.</p>
